## Sub-Model Creation and Fine-Tuning
- **Choose Base Model**: Creators select a base AI model from a curated list, optimized for various content types (e.g., text, image, music).
- **Setup AIGC NFT Collection**: Define the collection's parameters, including theme, AI model specifications, and intended output.
- **NFT Price & Supply**: Set the initial pricing strategy and supply cap for the NFT collection to ensure scarcity and value.

## Create AIGC NFT
- **Inference and Mint AIGC NFT**:
  Pick sub-models tailored for specific content generation.
Generate content through AI inference.
Mint the generated content as NFTs on the blockchain.
- **Mint Fee Distribution**:
Automatically distribute minting fees among prompt and model owners, ensuring fair compensation for their contributions.

## Monetization on Story Protocol
- **Integrate IPA Register**: Implement an Intellectual Property Agreement (IPA) registry to protect creators' rights.
- **Integrate License**: Allow NFT owners to license their AI-generated content for commercial use.
- **Integrate Royalty Distribution**: Ensure ongoing royalty payments to original creators and prompt owners from secondary sales or commercial uses.

## Prompt Namespace
- **Prompt Auction**: Enable the registration and auction of unique prompt tags, allowing creators to monetize innovative ideas.
- **Prompt Detection**: Automatically detect when prompts are used for generating AIGC NFTs to ensure proper attribution and compensation.
- **Prompt Fractionalization**: Allow for the fractional ownership of prompt tags, enabling collective investment in high-potential prompts.
Advanced Search
- **Prompt Tags**: Enhance search capabilities to filter and discover NFTs based on specific prompt tags, facilitating a more targeted exploration of the marketplace.
