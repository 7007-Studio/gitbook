# 7007 Studio Documentation

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the development and monetization of AI models in cryptocurrency systems, marking a new era in the open source intelligence market. In exploring the role of blockchain in establishing AI models as a new asset class that conforms to the principles of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), we present 7007.Studio's AIGC-NFTs standard, an ERC-721 extension to Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) NFTs that utilizes zkML and opML for data validation;

## Vision and Mission&#x20;

7007.Studio envisions transforming AI models into a new class of valuable assets. Our vision is to empower creators by making AI models not only innovative in content but also valuable in the digital economy. Our mission is to provide a platform where AI model owners can monetize their creations as ERC-20 tokens and NFTs, making them accessible and valuable to a wider market. Our philosophy centers on innovation, empowerment, and openness. We believe in the potential of AI and blockchain to create a new era in the digital economy, emphasizing the value of AI models as assets and ensuring fair and clear transactions on our platform.

### Inspiration
Most AIGC creators don't have a transparent, fair way to monetize their creations, and using erc7007 and opML enables chained reasoning, which benefits both model creators and AIGC creators by turning each AI model into a collection, much like an NFT collection.

### How we built it
We used opML and erc-7007 to secure and validate results generated from a specific model, and integrated Story protocol functionality so every generated result can be registered and monetized on-chain with a programmable license module.

### What it Does
7007.studio allows AI models to be published and inferred on the chain, with each mint creation including prompts and their unique results. 7007.studio We also designed a revenue sharing mechanism for valuable hints whenever it is used to generate another result or even a copyright gain from a secondary market transaction.
